Mechanical Assembly
Backing Plate
Used a Normally Open Valve on the fluid system of the brakes.
Used Arduino for pressure sensor testing.
Designed  on SolidWorks.
 Used Ansys for simulations and factor of safety of mechanical parts.
What?
How?
Result!
Made a high efficient braking system that has two functionalities. 
Increased safety of the Hyperloop pod.
Reduced the cost by machining parts using  school machine shop.
Mechanical Brakes of the Hyperloop pod, which has two functionalities.
As a normal brakes helping the magnetic brakes to full stop the pod.
Stopping the pod automatically in case of emergency(power disruption in the pod).
